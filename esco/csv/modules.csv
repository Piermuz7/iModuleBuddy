Course_Applied_Computational_Intelligence,https://modulbeschreibungen.webapps.fhnw.ch/detail/23FS_9329854,Applied Computational Intelligence,"In general, the guiding principle of this module is as follows: (1) Take a real-world problem, (2) derive a simplified computational problem model (following the proposed 'optimization problem approach'), (3) apply a particular optimization method (belonging to Artificial respectively Computational Intelligence), (4) compute optimized solutions, and (5) discuss the results.
The objectives of the module are to enable the students to numerically solve 'nasty' real-world optimization problems by using special methods belonging to Artificial Intelligence (AI) - particularly nature-inspired methods, called Computational Intelligence (CI). This given numerical approach is applied for solving and optimizing complex problems in business (e.g. logistics, finance), computer science (e.g. game strategies) and engineering (e.g. bioinformatics, robotics).
The students learn about AI with a focus on CI as well as how to model, numerically simulate and optimize real-world problems on the computer. The following CI topics are particularly emphasized:Evolutionary Computation, Swarm Intelligence, Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic, Meta-Heuristics, Robotics, and future AI developments and consequences
The front classroom teaching is reduced to only short inputs to the topics and the module project. Using most of the learning time of this module, the students conduct their own research project including the modelling of an application problem, the development (i.e. coding, implementing, customizing) of a software prototype (artefact) based on design science research.
This project within this module (i.e. in-semester research project) is based on Computational Science projects. The students take a (rather complex) real-world problem, derive a simplified computational model problem abstracting the real-world problem while referring to the state-of-the-art in literature. Then, they implement (i.e. code, customize) this model together with an optimization method (preferably a CI-related method) into a software prototype. Afterwards, the students run computational experiments (simulations on the computer), take the numerically optimized solutions, and discuss the obtained results with respect to their contribution to the real-world problem.
This module project comprises the development (e.g. coding, implementation or at least the usage and customization) of a small software prototype and the writing of a short research paper. The process of writing a research paper in style of a scientific conference paper will also be explained during the module.
The benefits of the module for the students are the following:The students learn about Computational Intelligence (natured-inspired AI and meta-heuristics) and different disruptive application areas, e.g. robotics.They improve their knowledge about how to conduct small research projects and how to write research papers (like in Research Methods for Information Systems or the Master thesis).They get background knowledge of design science research (and they may want to further pursue it in a Master thesis or even in a PhD research).With respect to the practice- respectively application-orientation, the students learn to numerically model, simulate and solve complex real-world problems by applying modelling, simulation and optimization techniques in a design-science-based approach. (i.e. a software prototype respectively artefact is built).Finally, the students understand and differentiate what optimization means and how it works. They apply selected CI (nature-inspired AI) methods and meta-heuristics.
Important requirements are sufficient programming/coding experiences or at least a strong interest in computational thinking and the ability to search and customize a suitable optimization software. Different optimization platforms will be proposed in the module as a potential basis for the implementation of the software prototype in this research project. Nevertheless, many other optimization codes or platforms are suited as well.
The core competencies of this module are (a) 'problem solving' by applying numerical optimization to solve an application problem, 'design capability' by applying design science research, and 'analytical thinking' by applying modelling, simulation, and optimization to solve a real-world problem numerically on the computer.",elective,"Important requirements for participating satisfyingly in this module are sufficient programming respectively coding skills in a common programming language, such as Java, Python, C, C++ etc. Or, at least a very strong interest in computational thinking and the ability to customize a software, as described above. Otherwise, an extensive effort in obtaining coding skills in additional self-study must be considered. Further examples of valuable pre-knowledge additionally to coding experiences are: Skills in using a software platform suitable for optimization, such as MATLAB, R, NetLogo, GNU Octave etc. Interest in integrating, using, customizing, and updating existing optimization platforms and libraries, such as OpenCI, jMetal, TensorFlow etc. Ability to search open-source optimization frameworks from other projects in the Internet, to install, run and customize them, such as old ACI projects, Google OR-Tools etc.","Depending on the Covid situation or other circumstances (energy situation etc.) the lectures and the coaching are sensibly organized onsite or online.

Course_Cyber_Security_and_Cyber_Resilience,https://modulbeschreibungen.webapps.fhnw.ch/detail/23FS_9244980,Cyber Security and Cyber Resilience,"As threats to cyber security become increasingly ominous, sophisticated and unpredictable, CEOs, CIOs and other decision makers must address related risks. Large organizations must also manage complex networks of service providers and many of whom have access to customers, sensitive data and critical technology. Under these circumstances, many organizations struggle to maintain the continuous vigilance and end-to-end visibility across the entire service delivery chain that is essential to a viable cybersecurity strategy and the resulting operationalization.
In this course, we derive key challenges of cybersecurity and how effectively address them by adopting relevant frameworks, best practices as well as governance mechanisms claimed as 'cyber resilience'. Where appropriate, we also touch on areas of information or information security. Main areas discussed are aligned with the NIST framework:

    IDENTIFY, organizational understanding/awareness to managing cybersecurity risk to systems, people, assets, data, and capabilities
    PROTECT, safeguards based on standards (ISO 27K), frameworks (NIST, COBIT, CSX) and best practices (selective white papers, recommendations)

    DETECT, appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event
    RESPOND, indispensable actions after a cybersecurity event
    RECOVER, restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event and future resistance plans


Special emphasis will be placed on ´Data Privacy and Protection´ and ´Technical Insights´.
There will also be a view on the specifics and experiences of external parties, the ´Service Providers´. Therefore, an essential part of the course are the guest lectures by cyber security experts from the field and their solutions. The course does not focus on very technical aspects but on the systemic, governance and management level in dealing with cyber risks.
